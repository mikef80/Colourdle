## Welcome to Colourdle!

Colourdle was an idea that a friend came up with when I said I wanted to build a Wordle clone with a difference. I'm fairly new to coding, so this was a good challenge project for me and involved an awful lot of googling bits and pieces to teach myself how to do it.

It's far from perfect, the code is pretty messy as I didn't plan the whole thing out first, but it's my first *proper* creation.

Maybe one day I'll come back and rewrite it!
